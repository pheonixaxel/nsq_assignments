The Category table has a ParentCategoryID which references its own CategoryID. This allows categories to be parents or children (subcategories). If ParentCategoryID is NULL, the category is a main category; if it has a value, it's a subcategory.
The Book table contains details about the books.
The BookCategory junction table creates a many-to-many relationship between books and categories. This allows for a book to be associated with multiple categories and/or subcategories.
